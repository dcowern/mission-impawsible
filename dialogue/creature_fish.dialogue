~ greeting

Fish: *blub blub* You speak the water tongue? Remarkable!
Fish: Few cats ever learned this art, even in the old days.
- What secrets do the waters hold?
	Fish: The river carries memories. It flows from the mountains where ice magic was born.
	Fish: Deep beneath the ocean, there is an ancient structure. I've seen its glow.
	Fish: Perhaps it holds a clue to the gem you seek.
	=> END
- What happened when the magic disappeared?
	Fish: The water grew cold and still. The currents lost their song.
	Fish: We fish felt it most of all — the silence where music used to be.
	=> END
- Thank you, fish.
	Fish: *blub* May the currents guide you, gem-blooded one.
	=> END
