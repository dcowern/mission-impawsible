Bird: *chirp chirp* You... you can understand me?
Bird: Amazing! No one has spoken our language in ages.
- What can you see from up high?
	Bird: I fly over the whole land. The mountains to the north hide ancient secrets.
	Bird: I've seen strange lights near the Alpine Peaks. Dragons guard something there.
	=> END
- Have you heard of the gem?
	Bird: The gem? The old ones sang of it. A brilliant light that made the world turn.
	Bird: Some say it's hidden where the five elements meet.
	=> END
- Just passing through.
	Bird: *chirp* Come back anytime!
	=> END
