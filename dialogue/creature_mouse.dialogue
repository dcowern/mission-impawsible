~ greeting

Mouse: *squeak* A cat! A talking cat! Don't eat me!
Mouse: Wait... you're different. You have the old magic.
- I won't hurt you. What do you know about underground paths?
	Mouse: The tunnels! Yes, we mice know every tunnel under these lands.
	Mouse: There's a passage beneath the forest that leads to a hidden chamber.
	Mouse: Tuna coins are scattered down there, forgotten by everyone.
	=> END
- Tell me about the forest.
	Mouse: The forest is deep and old. Woodland magic is strongest there.
	Mouse: The vines remember the old ways. If you have woodland magic, they'll help you.
	=> END
- Goodbye, little one.
	Mouse: *squeak* Be careful out there, cat-friend!
	=> END
