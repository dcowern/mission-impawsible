~ awakening

Elder Cat: Ah, young one. Come closer. I have been waiting for you.
Elder Cat: You feel it, don't you? That stirring in your blood?
Elder Cat: Let me tell you a story...

~ lore

Elder Cat: There used to be cats that had magic abilities: fire, ice, woodland, dragon taming, and speaking with different creatures.
Elder Cat: Suddenly the Earth began to shake.
Elder Cat: The Earth stopped spinning and then the cats that had magic had no more magic because the gem that the cats harnessed the magic from had disappeared.
Elder Cat: Since then no one has had magic - until now.
Elder Cat: You have the gem blood running through your veins.
Elder Cat: You have been chosen to find the gem.

~ coins

Elder Cat: You got two tuna coins. You can use the tuna coins to level up your powers.
Elder Cat: Seek out the Ability Shrine to the east. There you can channel your coins into magical discipline.
Elder Cat: But first... I sense a greater purpose calls you.

~ quest_start

Elder Cat: An ancient scroll lies hidden in the ruins to the north.
Elder Cat: It contains the first clue to the gem's resting place.
Elder Cat: Find the scroll and bring it back to me. Only then can we begin to unravel this mystery.
- I'll find the scroll.
	Elder Cat: Go with caution, young one. The world beyond the village is not as safe as it once was.
	=> END
- Tell me more about the magic.
	Elder Cat: Each discipline draws from a different aspect of the gem's power.
	Elder Cat: Fire burns with passion. Ice preserves with patience. Woodland grows with wisdom.
	Elder Cat: Dragon taming requires courage. And speaking with creatures... that requires empathy.
	Elder Cat: Master them all, and you may yet restore what was lost.

~ quest_complete

Elder Cat: You found the scroll! Let me see...
Elder Cat: Yes... these markings describe five trials, one for each magical discipline.
Elder Cat: Complete the trials, and the gem's location will be revealed.
Elder Cat: The trials are scattered across the land. You must seek them out.
=> END

~ ambient

Elder Cat: The gem calls to those with the blood. You are special, young one.
=> END
